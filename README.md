#Apple Stock Price Analysis and Twitter Posting

This Python script retrieves real-time Apple stock data via an API. It analyzes the price variation (wether the stock has increased 
or decreased) over a defined period. Based on the analysis, the script automatically generates a message indicating the stock's trend 
and publishes this update on a Twitter account.
